I participated in this hackathon with a team of three of us. It was a very interesting experience. We chose to work from home. First, we had to learn about the ABB Robot Studio program and watch the tutorials, and only then did we start the task.

In addition, there is a story behind our work. Everything went well and smoothly with a lot of laughter and coffee, while the other members did not get tired and went to bed to take a nap. Energetic and optimistic, I continue to work on the task (on the computer where we combined all the versions and edited the codes - it was our first version of the solution that we wanted to further improve as much as we could in the remaining time). During my work, the program only suddenly crashed. I didn't know what to do. I had to restart the computer, and the BOOM part of the solution disappeared forever (since we didn't have a backup version). The first problem was what to say to the other members of the team and in addition to how we will get everything in the remaining 8 hours. In the end, we did not reach the end to complete the solution, but for the most part, we did. I am proud of my friends who did not get angry. We continued to work as quickly and efficiently as possible. We learned about ABB Robot Studio, but also about team spirit!
